# vscode-fill README

This extension implements a very basic version of Emacs fill-paragraph and
auto-fill mode.

## Features

Spaces are automatically inserted into plaintext files to wordwrap as you type,
as in Emacs. Currently only plaintext files are used.

vscode-fill.fill-paragraph (Alt+Q) will word wrap (fill) the current
paragraph.
